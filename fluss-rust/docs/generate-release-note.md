# Generate Release Note

Use GitHub's **Generate release notes** to produce a draft from merged PRs between tags. Categories (Added, Fixed, Docs, etc.) are configured in [.github/release.yml](../.github/release.yml).

1. Go to [Create a new release](https://github.com/apache/fluss-rust/releases/new).
2. In **Choose a tag**, pick the release tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`).
3. Click **Generate release notes**.
4. Copy the generated content for **CHANGELOG.md** or the GitHub Release description. When publishing the release, add the official download link, checksums/verification, and install instructions (see [creating-a-release.md](creating-a-release.md)).

See [creating-a-fluss-rust-release.md](creating-a-fluss-rust-release.md) and [GitHub: Automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes).
